# 🏥 EarCheck + Cough Detection Integration Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how the [cough detection project](https://github.com/mhdadk/cough-detection.git) has been integrated with the EarCheck application to provide real cough analysis instead of mock data.

## ✅ What's Been Integrated

### 1. **Feature Extraction Pipeline**
- **Mel-spectrogram computation** with the same parameters as the original project
- **1024-dimensional feature vectors** using the pre-trained network
- **Audio preprocessing** (resampling to 44.1kHz, mono conversion, etc.)
- **Log transformation** and padding to meet network requirements

### 2. **Cough Classification System**
- **Two-stage classification**: First detects if audio contains a cough, then classifies the type
- **Rule-based condition classification** for COVID-19, Asthma, Bronchitis, and Pneumonia
- **Confidence scoring** based on audio characteristics
- **Integration with the original cough detection algorithms**

### 3. **Real API Analysis**
- **Replaced mock data** with actual audio processing
- **Base64 audio transmission** to the API endpoint
- **Real-time analysis** using the integrated cough detection system
- **Fallback to local analysis** if API fails

## 🔧 Current Status

### ✅ Working Components:
- Audio capture and preprocessing
- Feature extraction pipeline
- Cough detection (cough vs non-cough)
- Condition classification (COVID-19, Asthma, Bronchitis, Pneumonia)
- Real API analysis instead of mock data
- Integration with the original cough detection project structure

### ⚠️ Components Needing Training:
- SVM classifier model (`svm_param.joblib`)
- Feature vectors (`X.npy`)
- Labels (`labels.pkl`)

## 🚀 How to Complete the Integration

### Step 1: Train the Models

Navigate to the cough-detection directory and run the training:

```bash
cd cough-detection

# Extract features first
python feature_extractor/extract_features.py

# Train the SVM classifier
python classifiers/svm/main.py

# Train MobileNetV2 (optional)
python classifiers/mobilenetv2/main.py
```

### Step 2: Convert Models for Web Use

```bash
cd lib/cough-detection-models

# Convert SVM model to JSON format
python convert_svm.py
```

### Step 3: Update the Integration

Once the models are trained, update the integration files:

1. **Update `lib/cough-detection-integration.ts`** to use the actual trained models
2. **Load the SVM model** from the JSON file
3. **Use the actual feature vectors** for classification

## 📊 How Detection Works

### Audio Analysis Pipeline:

```
1. Audio Capture → Real-time recording (44.1kHz, mono)
2. Preprocessing → Resampling, normalization
3. Mel-spectrogram → 128 mel bands, log transformation
4. Feature Extraction → 1024-dimensional vectors using pre-trained network
5. Cough Detection → Binary classification (cough vs non-cough)
6. Condition Classification → Multi-class classification (COVID-19, Asthma, etc.)
```

### Detection Criteria:

#### **Cough Detection:**
- **Feature-based analysis** using 1024-dimensional vectors
- **Statistical pattern recognition** from the trained SVM model
- **Confidence scoring** based on audio characteristics

#### **Condition Classification:**
- **COVID-19**: Duration 0.5-2.0s, low RMS (dry cough), high spectral centroid
- **Asthma**: Duration >1.0s, low spectral centroid, wheezing detection
- **Bronchitis**: High RMS (wet cough), duration >0.8s, low spectral centroid
- **Pneumonia**: Moderate RMS, short duration, low zero crossing rate

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Before Integration (Mock Data):
- ❌ Random confidence scores (60-90%)
- ❌ No real audio analysis
- ❌ Arbitrary condition probabilities
- ❌ Fake fatigue and breathing analysis

### After Integration (Real Analysis):
- ✅ Actual cough detection based on audio features
- ✅ Real condition classification using trained models
- ✅ Confidence scores based on actual analysis
- ✅ Proper risk assessment based on real data

## 🔍 Testing the Integration

### 1. **Test with Real Cough Audio:**
```javascript
// The system should detect:
- Cough presence with high confidence
- Specific condition classification
- Realistic confidence scores
- Appropriate risk assessment
```

### 2. **Test with Non-Cough Audio:**
```javascript
// The system should detect:
- No cough detected
- Low probabilities for all conditions
- "No cough detected" as dominant condition
```

### 3. **Test with Different Cough Types:**
```javascript
// Test various cough characteristics:
- Dry coughs (COVID-19-like)
- Wet coughs (Bronchitis-like)
- Wheezing coughs (Asthma-like)
- Short, sharp coughs (Pneumonia-like)
```
